# Evaluating tuning strategies for random forest hyperparameters with regards to prediction performance of clinical prediction models and computational time

All included information is accurate; some information is missing regarding recently uploaded files. Information will be updated before May 15th, 2023.

## What to run?

### To reproduce the research report (preliminary results)

.R scripts (as opposed to .Rmd files) are necessary as they are loaded by the .Rmd files. The .R files in the ResearchReport folder are prior versions of the .R files outisde this folder: this is so that the report can be reproduced exactly as it was. Data is loaded within the .Rmd files. If wanting to fully reproduce the entire study, run Study1_pilot.Rmd (but be aware that this can take up to 19 hours), then ResearchReport.Rmd. Data generated by Study1_pilot.Rmd (i.e., information on how each tuning procedure performed on each dataset, which is the data used to generate tables and figures in the study) is saved in pilot.RData and loaded in ResearchReport.Rmd, so one may choose to run only ResearchReport.Rmd.

### To reproduce the study

This is not possible as of yet: some required files have not yet been uploaded. This will be done before May 15th, 2023.
